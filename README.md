<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

The Online Courses Landscape Analysis project focuses on analyzing an online courses dataset sourced from Kaggle to understand trends in course offerings, learner engagement, and skill demand. Using Power BI, the project transforms raw educational data into an interactive and insightful dashboard that highlights key performance indicators such as total courses, total instructors, total views, and average course duration.
The report provides a structured walkthrough of category-wise and sub-category-wise course distribution, in-demand skills, language preferences, course duration impact on viewership, and instructor performance. Through intuitive visuals and business-focused insights, the project demonstrates how data analytics can support strategic decisions for ed-tech platforms, instructors, and content planners by identifying growth opportunities and improving learner engagement.
